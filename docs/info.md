# About Me

I'm Anthony Elkommos Youssef, a highly motivated Computer Science graduate with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. My passion lies in shaping the future of AI and pushing the boundaries of Engineering and Mathematics. With a solid foundation in software engineering and an expertise in various frameworks like .NET, Angular, React, and Spring, I thrive on designing and deploying innovative solutions.

Throughout my educational journey at Northeastern University, I delved deep into statistical modeling, web crawling, and data mining, which has been instrumental in my success in analysing data and building successful integrations of AWS S3 AI/ML models, predictive models, web scraping, and regression models.

My professional experience, including roles at eClinical Solutions and Columbia University, has honed my abilities in web app development, database management, and system optimization. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to take on new challenges.

Beyond my technical skills, I'm deeply committed to leadership and mentorship, as evidenced by my involvement in various organizations such as the Key of Life Scouting Group and the Young Alumni Advisory Board. I believe in leaving a positive impact wherever I go, whether it's through my coding or my contributions to the community.
